## Language
[🇺🇸](README.md) | [🇷🇺](languages/RU/README.md)

## Who We Are
We are **B4DCATs**, a community of developers, engineers, and enthusiasts  
who build **free tools for independent digital infrastructure**.  

We believe that **true power lies in simplicity, transparency, and control over your own tools**.  

---

## Our Mission
- Create **open-source utilities** for communication, automation, and infrastructure.  
- Build products that can be used **in the terminal, on servers, at home**.  
- Unite people who share the values of **freedom, minimalism, and independence from corporations**.  

---

## Our Style
- **CLI first** — terminal as the foundation.  
- **Underground vibes** — like in old hacker movies: chats, logs, servers, code.  
- **Open source** — open code, accessible ideas, honest solutions.  
- **Community-driven** — we decide together where to go.  

---

## Our First Steps
- Set up **our own IRC server**.  
- Create a **CLI chat utility** (IRC + bridges to Telegram/Discord).  
- Build a set of small but useful **B4D utilities** (log monitoring, service management, API).

## Our Principles
1. **Minimalism** — we make simple and understandable tools.  
2. **Freedom** — everyone should have a choice, not imposed services.  
3. **Honesty** — open code, transparent goals.  
4. **Creativity** — we're not a corporation, but a laboratory of ideas.  
5. **Evolution** — small steps, but each leads to growth.
